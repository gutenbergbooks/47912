<a id="THE_BURNING_WHEEL"></a>THE BURNING WHEEL.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wearied of its own turning,<br />
Distressed with its own busy restlessness,<br />
Yearning to draw the circumferent pain&mdash;<br />
The rim that is dizzy with speed&mdash;<br />
To the motionless centre, there to rest,<br />
The wheel must strain through agony<br />
On agony contracting, returning<br />
Into the core of steel.<br />
And at last the wheel has rest, is still,<br />
Shrunk to an adamant core:<br />
Fulfilling its will in fixity.<br />
But the yearning atoms, as they grind<br />
Closer and closer, more and more<br />
Fiercely together, beget<br />
A flaming fire upward leaping,<br />
Billowing out in a burning,<br />
Passionate, fierce desire to find<br />
The infinite calm of the mother's breast.<br />
And there the flame is a Christ-child sleeping,<br />
Bright, tenderly radiant;<br />
All bitterness lost in the infinite<br />
Peace of the mother's bosom.<br />
But death comes creeping in a tide<br />
Of slow oblivion, till the flame in fear<br />
Wakes from the sleep of its quiet brightness<br />
And burns with a darkening passion and pain,<br />
Lest, all forgetting in quiet, it perish.<br />
And as it burns and anguishes it quickens,<br />
Begetting once again the wheel that yearns&mdash;<br />
Sick with its speed&mdash;for the terrible stillness<br />
Of the adamant core and the steel-hard chain.<br />
And so once more<br />
Shall the wheel revolve till its anguish cease<br />
In the iron anguish of fixity;<br />
Till once again<br />
Flame billows out to infinity,<br />
Sinking to a sleep of brightness<br />
In that vast oblivious peace.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="DOORS_OF_THE_TEMPLE"></a>DOORS OF THE TEMPLE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many are the doors of the spirit that lead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into the inmost shrine:</span><br />
And I count the gates of the temple divine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since the god of the place is God indeed.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And these are the gates that God decreed</span><br />
Should lead to his house:&mdash;kisses and wine,<br />
Cool depths of thought, youth without rest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And calm old age, prayer and desire,</span><br />
The lover's and mother's breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fire of sense and the poet's fire.</span><br />
<br />
But he that worships the gates alone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forgetting the shrine beyond, shall see</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The great valves open suddenly,</span><br />
Revealing, not God's radiant throne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the fires of wrath and agony.</span><br />
<br />

<a id="VILLIERS_DE_LISLE-ADAM"></a>VILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM.<br />
<br />
<br />
Up from the darkness on the laughing stage<br />
A sudden trap-door shot you unawares,<br />
Incarnate Tragedy, with your strange airs<br />
Of courteous sadness. Nothing could assuage<br />
The secular grief that was your heritage,<br />
Passed down the long line to the last that bears<br />
The name, a gift of yearnings and despairs<br />
Too greatly noble for this iron age.<br />
<br />
Time moved for you not in quotidian beats,<br />
But in the long slow rhythm the ages keep<br />
In their immortal symphony. You taught<br />
That not in the harsh turmoil of the streets<br />
Does life consist; you bade the soul drink deep<br />
Of infinite things, saying: "The rest is naught."<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="DARKNESS"></a>DARKNESS.<br />
<br />
<br />
My close-walled soul has never known<br />
That innermost darkness, dazzling sight,<br />
Like the blind point, whence the visions spring<br />
In the core of the gazer's chrysolite ...<br />
The mystic darkness that laps God's throne<br />
In a splendour beyond imagining,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So passing bright.</span><br />
<br />
But the many twisted darknesses<br />
That range the city to and fro,<br />
In aimless subtlety pass and part<br />
And ebb and glutinously flow;<br />
Darkness of lust and avarice,<br />
Of the crippled body and the crooked heart ...<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These darknesses I know.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="MOLE"></a>MOLE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tunnelled in solid blackness creeps<br />
The old mole-soul, and wakes or sleeps,<br />
He knows not which, but tunnels on<br />
Through ages of oblivion;<br />
Until at last the long constraint<br />
Of each-hand wall is lost, and faint<br />
Comes daylight creeping from afar,<br />
And mole-work grows crepuscular.<br />
Tunnel meets air and bursts; mole sees<br />
Men hugely walking ... or are they trees?<br />
And far horizons smoking blue,<br />
And chasing clouds for ever new?<br />
Green hills, like lighted lamps aglow<br />
Or quenching 'neath the cloud-shadow;<br />
Quenching and blazing turn by turn,<br />
Spring's great green signals fitfully burn.<br />
Mole travels on, but finds the steering<br />
A harder task of pioneering<br />
Than when he thridded through the strait<br />
Blind catacombs that ancient fate<br />
Had carved for him. Stupid and dumb<br />
And blind and touchless he had come<br />
A way without a turn; but here,<br />
Under the sky, the passenger<br />
Chooses his own best way; and mole<br />
Distracted wanders, yet his hole<br />
Regrets not much wherein he crept,<br />
But runs, a joyous nympholept,<br />
This way and that, by all made mad&mdash;<br />
River nymph and oread,<br />
Ocean's daughters and Lorelei,<br />
Combing the silken mystery,<br />
The glaucous gold of her rivery tresses&mdash;<br />
Each haunts the traveller, each possesses<br />
The drunken wavering soul awhile;<br />
Then with a phantom's cock-crow smile<br />
Mocks craving with sheer vanishment.<br />
<br />
Mole-eyes grow hawk's: knowledge is lent<br />
In grudging driblets that pay high<br />
Unconscionable usury<br />
To unrelenting life. Mole learns<br />
To travel more secure; the turns<br />
Of his long way less puzzling seem,<br />
And all those magic forms that gleam<br />
In airy invitation cheat<br />
Less often than they did of old.<br />
<br />
The earth slopes upward, fold by fold<br />
Of quiet hills that meet the gold<br />
Serenity of western skies.<br />
Over the world's edge with clear eyes<br />
Our mole transcendent sees his way<br />
Tunnelled in light: he must obey<br />
Necessity again and thrid<br />
Close catacombs as erst he did,<br />
Fate's tunnellings, himself must bore<br />
Through the sunset's inmost core.<br />
The guiding walls to each-hand shine<br />
Luminous and crystalline;<br />
And mole shall tunnel on and on,<br />
Till night let fall oblivion.<br />
<br />

<a id="THE_TWO_SEASONS"></a>THE TWO SEASONS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Summer, on himself intent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Passed without, for nothing caring</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Save his own high festival.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My windows, blind and winkless staring,</span><br />
Wondered what the pageant meant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor ever understood at all.</span><br />
And oh, the pains of sentiment!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The loneliness beyond all bearing ...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mucus and spleen and gall!</span><br />
<br />
But now that grey November peers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In at my fire-bright window pane?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And all its misty spires and trees</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Loom in upon me through the rain</span><br />
And question of the light that cheers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The room within&mdash;now my soul sees</span><br />
Life, where of old were sepulchres;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And in these new-found sympathies</span><br />
Sinks petty hopes and loves and fears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And knows that life is not in vain.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="TWO_REALITIES"></a>TWO REALITIES.<br />
<br />
<br />
A waggon passed with scarlet wheels<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a yellow body, shining new.</span><br />
"Splendid!" said I. "How fine it feels<br />
To be alive, when beauty peels<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The grimy husk from life." And you</span><br />
<br />
Said, "Splendid!" and I thought you'd seen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That waggon blazing down the street;</span><br />
But I looked and saw that your gaze had been<br />
On a child that was kicking an obscene<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brown ordure with his feet.</span><br />
<br />
Our souls are elephants, thought I,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remote behind a prisoning grill,</span><br />
With trunks thrust out to peer and pry<br />
And pounce upon reality;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And each at his own sweet will</span><br />
<br />
Seizes the bun that he likes best<br />
And passes over all the rest.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="QUOTIDIAN_VISION"></a>QUOTIDIAN VISION.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a sadness in the street,<br />
And sullenly the folk I meet<br />
Droop their heads as they walk along,<br />
Without a smile, without a song.<br />
A mist of cold and muffling grey<br />
Falls, fold by fold, on another day<br />
That dies unwept. But suddenly,<br />
Under a tunnelled arch I see<br />
On flank and haunch the chestnut gleam<br />
Of horses in a lamplit steam;<br />
And the dead world moves for me once more<br />
With beauty for its living core.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="VISION"></a>VISION.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had been sitting alone with books,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till doubt was a black disease,</span><br />
When I heard the cheerful shout of rooks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the bare, prophetic trees.</span><br />
<br />
Bare trees, prophetic of new birth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You lift your branches clean and free</span><br />
To be a beacon to the earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A flame of wrath for all to see.</span><br />
<br />
And the rooks in the branches laugh and shout<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To those that can hear and understand;</span><br />
"Walk through the gloomy ways of doubt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the torch of vision in your hand."</span><br />

<br />
Slow-moving moonlight once did pass<br />
Across the dreaming looking-glass,<br />
Where, sunk inviolably deep,<br />
Old secrets unforgotten sleep<br />
Of beauties unforgettable.<br />
<br />
But dusty cobwebs are woven now<br />
Across that mirror, which of old<br />
Saw fingers drawing back the gold<br />
From an untroubled brow;<br />
And the depths are blinded to the moon,<br />
And their secrets forgotten, for ever untold.<br />

Youth as it opens out discloses<br />
The sinister metempsychosis<br />
Of lilies dead and turned to roses<br />
Red as an angry dawn.<br />
But lilies, remember, are grave-side flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While slow bright rose-leaves sail</span><br />
Adrift on the music of happiest hours;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And those lilies, cold and pale,</span><br />
Hide fiery roses beneath the lawn<br />

I.<br />
<br />
'TWas I that leaned to Amoret<br />
With: "What if the briars have tangled Time,<br />
Till, lost in the wood-ways, he quite forget<br />
How plaintive in cities at midnight sounds the chime<br />
Of bells slow-dying from discord to the hush whence<br />
they rose and met.<br />
<br />
"And in the forest we shall live free,<br />
Free from the bondage that Time has made<br />
To hedge our soul from its liberty?<br />
We shall not fear what is mighty, and unafraid<br />
Shall look wide-eyed at beauty, nor shrink from its majesty."<br />
<br />
But Amoret answered me again:<br />
"We are lost in the forest, you and I;<br />
Lost, lost, not free, though no bonds restrain;<br />
For no spire rises for comfort, no landmark in the sky,<br />
And the long glades as they curve from sight are dark<br />
with a nameless pain.<br />
<br />
And Time creates what he devours,&mdash;<br />
Music that sweetly dreams itself away,<br />
Frail-swung leaves of autumn and the scent of flowers,<br />
And the beauty of that poised moment, when the day<br />
Hangs 'twixt the quiet of darkness and the mirth of the<br />
sunlit hours."<br />
<br />
<br />

II.<br />
<br />
Mottled and grey and brown they pass,<br />
The wood-moths, wheeling, fluttering;<br />
And we chase and they vanish; and in the grass<br />
Are starry flowers, and the birds sing<br />
Faint broken songs of the dying spring.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on the beech-bole, smooth and grey,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some lover of an older day</span><br />
Has carved in time-blurred lettering<br />
One word only&mdash;"Alas."<br />

Lutes, I forbid you! You must never play,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When shimmeringly, glimpse by glimpse</span><br />
Seen through the leaves, the silken figures sway<br />
In measured dance. Never at shut of day,<br />
When Time perversely loitering limps<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through endless twilights, should your strings</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whisper of light remembered things</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That happened long ago and far away:</span><br />
Lutes, I forbid you! You must never play...<br />
<br />
And you, pale marble statues, far descried<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where vistas open suddenly,</span><br />
I bid you shew yourselves no more, but hide<br />
Your loveliness, lest too much glorified<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By western radiance slantingly</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shot down the glade, you turn from stone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To living gods, immortal grown,</span><br />
And, ageless, mock my beauty's fleeting pride,<br />
You pale, relentless statues, far descried...<br />

Old ghosts that death forgot to ferry<br />
Across the Lethe of the years-<br />
These are my friends, and at their tears<br />
I weep and with their mirth am merry.<br />
On a high tower, whose battlements<br />
Give me all heaven at a glance,<br />
I lie long summer nights in trance,<br />
Drowsed by the murmurs and the scents<br />
That rise from earth, while the sky above me<br />
Merges its peace with my soul's peace,<br />
Deep meeting deep. No stir can move me,<br />
Nought break the quiet of my release:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In vain the windy sunlight raves</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the hush and gloom of polar caves.</span><br />

One head of my soul's amphisbaena<br />
Turns to the daytime's dust and sweat;<br />
But evenings come, when I would forget<br />
The sordid strife of the arena.<br />
<br />
And then my other self will creep<br />
Along the scented twilight lanes<br />
To where a little house contains<br />
A hoard of books, a gift of sleep.<br />
<br />
Its windows throw a friendly light<br />
Between the narrowing shutter slats,<br />
And, golden as the eyes of cats,<br />
Shine me a welcome through the night.<br />

I seek the quietude of stones<br />
Or of great oxen, dewlap-deep<br />
In meadows of lush grass, where sleep<br />
Drifts, tufted, on the air or drones<br />
On flowery traffic. Sleep atones<br />
For sin, comforting eyes that weep.<br />
O'er me, Lethean darkness, creep<br />
Unfelt as tides through dead men's bones!<br />
<br />
In that metallic sea of hair,<br />
Fragrance! I come to drown despair<br />
Of wings in dark forgetfulness.<br />
No love ... Love is self-known, aspires<br />
To heights unearthly. I ask less,&mdash;<br />
Sleep born of satisfied desires.<br />

<a id="THE_GARDEN"></a>THE GARDEN.<br />

<br />
There shall be dark trees round me:&mdash;I insist<br />
On cypresses: I'm terribly romantic&mdash;<br />
And glimpsed between shall move the whole Atlantic,<br />
Now leaden dull, now subtle with grey mist,<br />
Now many jewelled, when the waves are kissed<br />
By revelling sunlight and the corybantic<br />
South-Western wind: so, troubled, passion-frantic,<br />
The poet's mind boils gold and amethyst.<br />
<br />
There shall be seen the infinite endeavour<br />
Of a sad fountain, white against the sky<br />
And poised as it strains up, but doomed to break<br />
In weeping music; ever fair and ever<br />
Young ... and the bright-eyed wood-gods as they slake<br />
Their thirst in it, are silent, reverently ...<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
No dip and dart of swallows wakes the black<br />
Slumber of the canal:&mdash;a mirror dead<br />
For lack of loveliness remembered<br />
From ancient azures and green trees, for lack<br />
Of some white beauty given and flung back,<br />
Secret, to her that gave: no sun has bled<br />
To wake an echo here of answering red;<br />
The surface stirs to no leaf's wind-blown track.<br />
<br />
Between unseeing walls the waters rest,<br />
Lifeless and hushed, till suddenly a swan<br />
Glides from some broader river blue as day,<br />
And with the mirrored magic of his breast<br />
Creates within that barren water-way<br />
New life, new loveliness, and passes on.<br />

I'm sick of clownery and Owlglass tricks;<br />
Damn the whole crowd of you I I hate you all.<br />
The same, night after night, from powdered stall<br />
To sweating gallery, your faces fix<br />
In flux an idiot mean. The Apteryx<br />
You worship is no victory; you call<br />
On old stupidity, God made to crawl<br />
For tempting with world-wisdom's narcotics.<br />
<br />
I'll break a window through my prison! See,<br />
The sunset bleeds among the roofs; comes night,<br />
Dark blue and calm as music dying out.<br />
Is it escape? No, the laugh's turned on me!<br />
I kicked at cardboard, gaped at red limelight;<br />
You laughed and cheered my latest knockabout.<br />

Red wine that slowly leaned and brimmed the shell<br />
Of pearl, where lips had touched, as light and swift<br />
As naked petals of the rose adrift<br />
Upon the lazy-luted ritournelle<br />
Of summer bee-song: laughing as they fell,<br />
Gold memories: dream incense, childhood's gift,<br />
Blue as the smoke that far horizons lift,<br />
Tenuous as the wings of Ariel:&mdash;<br />
<br />
These treasured things I laid upon the pyre;<br />
And the flame kindled, and I fanned it high,<br />
And, strong in hope, could watch the crumbling past.<br />
Eager I knelt before the waning fire,<br />
Phoenix, to greet thine immortality ...<br />
But there was naught but ashes at the last.<br />

<br />
Were I to die, you'd break your heart, you say.<br />
Well, if it do but bend, I'm satisfied&mdash;<br />
Bend and rebound&mdash;for hearts are temper-tried,<br />
Mild steel, not hardened, with the spring and play<br />
Of excellent tough swords. It's not that way<br />
That you'll be perishing. But when I've died,<br />
When snap! my light goes out, what will betide<br />
You, if the heart-breaks give you leave to stay?<br />
<br />
What will be left, I wonder, if you lose<br />
All that you gave me? "All? A year or so<br />
Out of a life," you say. But worlds, say I,<br />
Of kisses timeless given in ecstasy<br />
That gave me Real You. I die: you go<br />
With me. What's left? Limbs, clothes, a pair of shoes?...<br />

The West has plucked its flowers and has thrown<br />
Them fading on the night. Out of the sky's<br />
Black depths there smiles a greeting from those eyes,<br />
Where all the Real, all I have ever known<br />
Of the divine is held. And not alone<br />
Do I stand here now ... a presence seems to rise:<br />
Your voice sounds near across my memories,<br />
And answering fingers brush against my own.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is you: for evening holds those strands<br />
Of fire and darkness twined in one to make<br />
Your loveliness a web of magic mesh,<br />
Whose cross-weft harmony of soul and flesh<br />
Shadows a thought or glows, when smiles awake,<br />
Like sunlight passionate on southern lands.<br />

Comrade, now that you're merry<br />
And therefore true,<br />
Say&mdash;where would you like to die<br />
And have your friend to bury<br />
What once was you?<br />
"On the top of a hill<br />
With a peaceful view<br />
Of country where all is still?"...<br />
Great God, not I!<br />
I'd lie in the street<br />
Where two streams meet<br />
And there's noise enough to fill<br />
The outer ear,<br />
While within the brain can beat<br />
Marches of death and life,<br />
Glory and joy and fear,<br />
Peace of the sort that moves<br />
And clash of strife<br />
And routs of armies fleeing.<br />
There would I shake myself clear<br />
Out of the deep-set grooves<br />
Of my sluggish being.<br />

There's a church by a lake in Italy<br />
Stands white on a hill against the sky?<br />
And a path of immemorial cobbles<br />
Leads up and up, where the pilgrim hobbles<br />
Past a score or so of neat reposories,<br />
Where you stop and breathe and tell your rosaries<br />
To the shrined terra-cotta mannikins,<br />
That expound with the liveliest quirks and grins<br />
Known texts of Scripture. But no long stay<br />
Should the pilgrim make upon his way;<br />
But as means to the end these shrines stand here<br />
To guide to something holier,<br />
The church on the hilltop.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Your heaven's so,</span><br />
With a path leading up to it past a row<br />
Of votary Priapulids;<br />
At each you pause and tell your beads<br />
Along the quintuple strings of sense:<br />
Then on, to face Heaven's eminence,<br />
New stimulated, new inspired.<br />

If that a sparkle of true starshine be<br />
That led my way; if some diviner thing<br />
Than common thought urged me to fashioning<br />
Close-woven links of burnished poetry;<br />
Then all the heaven that one time dwelt in me<br />
Has fled, leaving the body triumphing.<br />
Dead flesh it seems, with not a dream to bring<br />
Visions that better warm immediacy.<br />
<br />
Why have my visions left me, what could kill<br />
That feeble spark, which yet had life and heat?<br />
Fulfilment shewed a present rich and fair:<br />
I strive to mount, but catch the nearest still:<br />
Souls have been drowned between heart's beat and beat,<br />
And trapped and tangled in a woman's hair.<br />

Mother of all my future memories,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mistress of my new life, which but to-day</span><br />
Began, when I beheld, deep in your eyes,<br />
My own love mirrored and the warm surprise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the first kiss swept both our souls away,</span><br />
<br />
Your love has freed me; for I was oppressed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By my own devil, whose unwholesome breath</span><br />
Tarnished my youth, leaving to me at best<br />
Age lacking comfort of a soul at rest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And weariness beyond the hope of death.</span><br />

<br />
Ah, those were days of silent happiness!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I never spoke, and had no need to speak,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While on the windy down-land, cheek by cheek,</span><br />
The slow-driven sun beheld us. Each caress<br />
Had oratory for its own defence;<br />
And when I kissed or felt her fingers press,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I envied not Demosthenes his Greek,</span><br />
Nor Tully for his Latin eloquence.<br />

When life burns low as the fire in the grate<br />
And all the evening's books are read,<br />
I sit alone, save for the dead<br />
And the lovers I have grown to hate.<br />
<br />
But all at once the narrow gloom<br />
Of hatred and despair expands<br />
In tenderness: thought stretches hands<br />
To welcome to the midnight room<br />
<br />
Another presence:&mdash;a memory<br />
Of how last year in the sunlit field,<br />
Laughing, you suddenly revealed<br />
Beauty in immortality.<br />
<br />
For so it is; a gesture strips<br />
Life bare of all its make-believe.<br />
All unprepared we may receive<br />
Our casual apocalypse.<br />
<br />
Sheer beauty, then you seemed to stir<br />
Unbodied soul; soul sleeps to-night,<br />
And love comes, dimming spirit's sight,<br />
When body plays interpreter.<br />

I have tried to remember the familiar places,&mdash;<br />

by the sea,&mdash;<br />
I have tried to people the past with dear known faces,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But you were haunting me.</span><br />
<br />
Like a remorse, insistent, pitiless,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You have filled my spirit, you were ever at hand;</span><br />
You have mocked my gods with your new loveliness:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Broken the old shrines stand.</span><br />

<br />
In this wood&mdash;how the hazels have grown!&mdash;<br />
I left a treasure all my own<br />
Of childish kisses and laughter and pain;<br />
Left, till I might come back again<br />
To take from the familiar earth<br />
My hoarded secret and count its worth.<br />
And all the spider-work of the years,<br />
All the time-spun gossamers,<br />
Dewed with each succeeding spring;<br />
And the piled up leaves the Autumns fling<br />
To the sweet corruption of death on death....<br />
At the sudden stir of my spirit's breath<br />
All scattered. New and fair and bright<br />
As ever it was, before my sight<br />
The treasure lay, and nothing missed.<br />
So having handled all and kissed,<br />
I put them back, adding one new<br />
And precious memory of you.<br />
<br />

<a id="FRAGMENT"></a>FRAGMENT.<br />
<br />
<br />
We're German scholars poring over life,<br />
As over a Greek manuscript that's torn<br />
And stained beyond repair. Our eyes of horn<br />
Read one or two poor letters; and what strife,<br />
What books on books begotten for their sake!<br />
But we enjoy it; and meanwhile neglect<br />
The line that's left us perfect from the wrecked<br />
Rich argosy, clear beyond doubts to make<br />
Conjectures of. So in my universe<br />
Of scribbled half-hid meanings you appear,<br />
Sole perfect symbol of the highest sphere;<br />
And life's great matrix crystal, whose depths nurse<br />
Soul's infinite reflections, glows in you<br />
With now uncertain radiance...<br />

<a id="THE_WALK"></a>THE WALK.<br />
<br />
<br />
I. THROUGH THE SUBURBS.<br />
<br />
Provincial Sunday broods above the town:<br />
The street's asleep; through a dim window drifts<br />
A small romance that hiccoughs up and down<br />
An air all trills and runs and sudden lifts<br />
To yearning sevenths poised ... not Chopin quite,<br />
But, oh, romantic; a tinsel world made bright<br />
With rose and honeysuckle's paper blooms,<br />
And where the moon's blue limelight and the glooms<br />
Of last-act scenes of passion are discreet.<br />
And when the tinkling stops and leaves the street<br />
Blank in the sunlight of the afternoon<br />
You feel a curtain dropped. Poor little tune!<br />
Perhaps our grandmother's dull girlhood days<br />
Were fired by you with radiances of pink,<br />
Heavenly, brighter far than she could think<br />
Anything might be ... till a greater blaze<br />
Tinged life's horizon, when he kissed her first,<br />
Our grandpapa. But a thin ghost still plays<br />
In music down the street, echoing the plaint<br />
Of far romance with its own sadder song<br />
Of Everyday; and as they walk along,...<br />
The young man and the woman, deep immersed<br />
In all the suburb-comedy around ...<br />
They seem to catch coherence in the sound<br />
Of that ghost-music, and the words come faint:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Oh the months and the days,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Oh sleeps and dinners,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Oh the planning of ways</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And quotidian means!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh endless vistas of mutton and greens,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh weekly mimblings of prayer and praise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Oh Evenings with All the Winners!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Monday sends the clothes to the wash</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And Saturday brings them home again:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Mon Dieu, la vie est par trop moche</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And Destiny is a sale caboche;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">But I'll give you heaven</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In a dominant seven,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And you shall not have lived in vain.</span><br />
<br />
"In vain," the girl repeats, "in vain, in vain ..."<br />
Your suburb's whole philosophy leads there.<br />
The ox-stall for our happiness, for pain,<br />
Poignant and sweet, the dull narcotic ache<br />
Of wretchedness, and in resigned despair<br />
A grim contentment ... ashen fruits to slake<br />
A nameless, quenchless thirst. The tinkling rain<br />
Of that small sentimental music wets<br />
Your parching suburb: it may sprout ... who knows?...<br />
In something red and silken like a rose,<br />
In sheaves of almost genuine violets.<br />
<br />
Faint chords, your sadness, secular, immense,<br />
Brims to the bursting this poor Actual heart.<br />
For surging through the floodgates that the sense<br />
On sudden lightly opens sweeps the Whole<br />
Into the narrow compass of its part.<br />
<br />
<i>He.</i><br />
<br />
Inedited sensation of the soul!<br />
You'd have us bless the Hire-Purchase System,<br />
Which now allows the poorest vampers<br />
To feel, as they abuse their piano's dampers,<br />
That angels have stooped down and kissed 'em<br />
With Ave-Maries from the infinite.<br />
But poor old Infinite's dead. Long live his heir,<br />
Lord Here-and-Now ... for all the rest<br />
Is windy nothingness, or at the best<br />
Home-made Chimera, bodied with despair,<br />
Headed with formless, foolish hope.<br />
<br />
<i>She.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">No, no!</span><br />
We live in verse, for all things rhyme<br />
With something out of space and time.<br />
<br />
<i>He.</i><br />
<br />
But in the suburb here life needs must flow<br />
In journalistic prose ...<br />
<br />
<i>She.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">But we have set</span><br />
Our faces towards the further hills, where yet<br />
The wind untainted and unbound may blow.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
II. FROM THE CREST.<br />
<br />
So through the squalor, till the sky unfolds<br />
To right and left its fringes, penned no more,<br />
A thin canal, 'twixt shore and ugly shore<br />
Of hovels, poured contiguous from the moulds<br />
Of Gothic horror. Town is left at last,<br />
Save for the tentacles that probe,... a squat<br />
Dun house or two, allotments, plot on plot<br />
Of cabbage, jejune, ripe or passed,<br />
Chequering with sick yellow or verdigris<br />
The necropolitan ground; and neat paved ways<br />
That edge the road ... the town's last nerves ... and cease,<br />
As if in sudden shame, where hedges raise<br />
Their dusty greenery on either hand.<br />
Their path mounts slowly up the hill;<br />
And, as they walk, to right and left expand<br />
The plain and the golden uplands and the blue<br />
Faint smoke of distances that fade from view;<br />
And at their feet, remote and still?<br />
The city spreads itself.<br />
<br />
<i>He.</i><br />
<br />
That glabrous dome that lifts itself so grand,<br />
There in the marish, is the omphalos,<br />
The navel, umbo, middle, central boss<br />
Of the unique, sole, true Cloud-Cuckoo Land.<br />
Drowsy with Sunday bells and Sunday beer<br />
Afoam in silver rumkins, there it basks,<br />
Thinking of labours past and future tasks<br />
And pondering on the end, forever near,<br />
Yet ever distant as the rainbow's spring.<br />
For still in Cuckoo-Land they're labouring,<br />
With hopes undamped and undiscouraged hearts:<br />
A little musty, but superb, they sit,<br />
Piecing a god together bit by bit<br />
Out of the chaos of his sundered parts.<br />
Unmoved, nay pitying, they view the grins<br />
And lewd grimaces of the folk that jeer ...<br />
The vulgar herd, gross monster at the best,<br />
Obscenum Mobile, the uttermost sphere,<br />
Alas, too much the mover of the rest,<br />
Though they turn sungates to its widdershins ...<br />
<br />
And in some half a million years perhaps<br />
God may at last be made ... a new, true Pan,<br />
An Isis templed in the soul of man,<br />
An Aphrodite with her thousand paps<br />
Streaming eternal wisdom.<br />
Yes, and man's vessel, all pavilioned out<br />
With silk and flags in the fair wind astream,<br />
Shall make the port at last, with a great shout<br />
Ringing from all her decks, and rocking there shall dream<br />
For ever, and dream true ... calm in those roads<br />
As lovers' souls at evening, when they swim<br />
Between the despairing sunset and the dim<br />
Blue memories of mountains lost to sight<br />
But, like half fancied, half remembered episodes<br />
Of childhood, guessed at through the veils of night.<br />
And the worn sailors at the mast who heard<br />
The first far bells and knew the sound for home,<br />
Who marked the land-weeds and the sand-stained foam<br />
And through the storm-blast saw a wildered bird<br />
Seek refuge at the mast-head ... these at last<br />
Shall earn due praise when all the hubbub's past;<br />
And Cuckoo-Landers not a few shall prove.<br />
<br />
<i>She.</i><br />
<br />
You have fast closed the temple gates;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You stand without in the noon-tides glow,</span><br />
But the innermost darkness, where God waits,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You do not know, you cannot know.</span><br />
